Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your AI Content Detector project:

# AI Content Detector

## Description
The **AI Content Detector** is a tool designed to analyze text and determine whether it is AI-generated or human-written. It utilizes the GPT-2 language model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, measuring metrics such as perplexity and entropy to differentiate between the two content types effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Transformers Library**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Regular Expressions (re)**
- **NumPy**

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and then install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the `AI_Content_Detector.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Input your text content into the designated cell.
3. Run the cells to analyze the text.
4. The output will display whether the content is AI-generated or human-written, along with various metrics.

## Example
```python
# Example usage
detector = Detection()
results = detector("Your input text goes here.")
print(results)
```
